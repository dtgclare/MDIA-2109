        <h1>What I found difficult last semester</h1>
        <p>
            Last semester, I found difficult to understand git and some of the
            basic structure.
        </p>
        <h2>My Action Plan</h2>
        <p>
            This semester, I plan to learn and practice more and do not hesitate
            to ask questions.
